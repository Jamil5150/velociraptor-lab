# velociraptor-lab

This repo is dedicated to hosting the files needed for my Velociraptor Deployment lab. For my C250 course, I will provide the virtual machine appliances in .ova format, along with a .docx file on the lab itself. This lab uses a premade Kali Linux VM along with a Windows Server 2022 VM, and both systems will be using [Velociraptor v0.74.2](https://github.com/Velocidex/velociraptor/releases/tag/v0.74). Internet connectivity is an issue that many people may face when working in labs, so I have made this lab accessible offline (assuming that the executable Velociraptor files are downloaded on both a Kali Linux VM and a Windows Server 2022 VM). I have made sure to include the virtual disks of the VMs in the .ova files, which should save some time.
