# velociraptor-lab

This repo is dedicated to hosting the files needed for my Velociraptor Deployment lab. For my C250 course, I will provide the virtual machine appliances in .ova format, along with a .docx file on the lab itself. This lab uses a premade Kali Linux VM along with a Windows Server 2022 VM, and both systems will be using [Velociraptor v0.74.2](https://github.com/Velocidex/velociraptor/releases/tag/v0.74). Internet connectivity is an issue that many people may face when working in labs, so I have made this lab accessible offline (assuming that the executable Velociraptor files are downloaded on both a Kali Linux VM and a Windows Server 2022 VM). I have made sure to include the virtual disks of the VMs in the .ova files, which should save some time.

To download the [Kali Linux](https://cccd0-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/jelfar_student_cccd_edu/EZZHgAOTMnVFqqXklv16zhQBcTq9gmobZisP-TDOwlkVjQ?e=lrrUlm) or [Windows Server 2022](https://cccd0-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/jelfar_student_cccd_edu/EYQR1og9lT1IsbCM3MGrjqsB7FAWqVbIa2OOFgclAZabvA?e=O9mHJH).ova files, click the hyperlinks. Please note that these files are only accessible via OneDrive due to GitHub limitations, and are locked to the Coast Community College District. 

If the VM files cannot be downloaded, download these Velociraptor files for the [Kali Linux](https://github.com/Velocidex/velociraptor/releases/download/v0.74/velociraptor-v0.74.2-linux-arm64) and [Windows Server 2022](https://github.com/Velocidex/velociraptor/releases/download/v0.74/velociraptor-v0.74.2-windows-amd64.exe) machines. 

Thank you for reading this! ~ Jamil
